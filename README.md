A Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard in Power BI provides a comprehensive view of loan performance and application metrics, including:  

1. **Loan Application Insights**: Total applications, approval rates, and trends over time.  
2. **Funded Amount**: Total and average loan amounts funded, segmented by loan types or regions.  
3. **Interest Rate Analysis**: Distribution of interest rates, average rates, and trends by loan category.  
4. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Average DTI, high-risk DTI segments, and its correlation with loan performance.  
5. **Loan Performance**: Categorization of good vs. bad loan applications based on repayment status, defaults, or risk ratings.  
6. **Demographics and Trends**: Analysis by applicant age, income levels, and geographic distribution.  

Interactive visuals like KPI cards, heat maps, and segment-wise breakdowns enable better decision-making for risk management and strategic planning.
